error reporting and log

why are there so many reflex pings?

contacts:
-anything from a known IP will be assumed to be from its associated user
-anything from a known user will be assumed to be from its most recently associated IP

make the notification be not the bell sound

add configurability through messenger.config. Almost all constants should be here

note to self: messages are maximum buf 1024 characters right now. That means a soft 738 character limit with base64 encoding

add a command to display to ping to a user with the haveInternet.pyw

scrolling functionality for main screen and message screen -- low priority. Probs need pyHook or sth
encrypt -- low priority
user specific ports -- v low priority
